Parameters are the internal values a model learns during training. They help the model make decisions about the data it processes. In neural networks, these parameters are weights (how much influence one neuron has on another) and biases (adjustments made to the output).

How Parameters Affect Output:
Context Understanding:

Small models (few parameters) understand basic input but may miss nuances.
Large models (many parameters) understand complex contexts and details better.
Output Complexity:

Small models generate simple, shorter responses.
Large models produce detailed, nuanced, and creative answers.
Multi-step Reasoning:

Small models struggle with complex tasks (e.g., abstract reasoning).
Large models can handle multi-step problems and sophisticated queries.
Generalization:

Small models may not handle diverse or rare inputs well.
Large models generalize better, making them more robust to new situations.
Conclusion:
More parameters improve a model's ability to understand context, generate detailed responses, and solve complex problems. However, larger models need more computational power. Smaller models are faster but less capable on complex tasks.
